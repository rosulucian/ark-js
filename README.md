See forked repo for install & run for ark-js.

For the purpose of this POC you also need to run the modified ark node at  https://github.com/rosulucian/ark-node-avm with npm run start:testnetdbg which will start an Ark node on a private testnet with only one delegate(you).

Once the modified Ark node is up you can use createContract to publish contracts to the network or use npm run poc to run the test.

Contract call transactions are coming up next.
